# Project Concepts of Data Science
**Description:**
The purpose of the project is the implementation of a Bloom filter. The concept of
this data structure was explained in the third session of the course. You can find
additional information on this data structure online, for instance on Wikipedia.
1. The development of the software should be done using version control
hosted on GitHub or Gitlab. If your repository is private, do not forget to
give me access. You should also follow up on whether the invitation has
been accepted, since such invitations easily get lost. Since you are
working in teams of two, GitHub/GitLab is also your tool to collaborate
within the team. You are expected to collaborate while developing the
code, so that should be reflected by the commit messages for the
repository. If there are no or few commit messages by a team member, I
will conclude that this person contributed little to the code and that will be
reflected by that personâ€™s grade. The repository should also contain a
README file that documents the content of the repository, as well as a
summary of your conclusions.
2. The Bloom filter should be either implemented using an object-oriented
approach, or a functional approach. Clearly, code quality is important. Your
code should be easy to read and documented clearly. You have seen
several examples in the course. The data structure is implemented in
Python as a module, so that it can be used in a Jupyter notebook for
demonstration purposes and testing, but also from a Python script for
benchmarking on the HPC infrastructure.
3. The implementation must be tested thoroughly for correctness as
explained several times in the course.
4. To implement a Bloom filter, you must define a family of hash functions.
These hash functions should be tested to verify that they produce
appropriate values. Note that these hash functions may work well for
certain data (e.g., natural language words) but not so well for other data
(e.g., random strings or DNA). Test with at least two data types.
5. Discuss the expected time and space complexity of your implementation.
6. The performance of the implementation has to be tested as well using a
large data sample. Time the insert and search functions for an increasing
number of words and create plots. These benchmarks should be
performed on the HPC infrastructure. Include the job script and the Python
test script in your repository, as well as the output of the benchmark runs.
Consult the [VSC documentation](https://docs.vscentrum.be/) if necessary.
7. Check how the false positive rate changes as a function of the number of
words inserted in the Bloom filter. Also check this if the number of words
exceeds the expected number of words for which the Bloom filter was
designed.
8. Check the compression rate of a Bloom filter as a function of the expected
number of and the rate of false positives.
